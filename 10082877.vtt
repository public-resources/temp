That's a tough question.

Don't worry, I'll find it.

than you.

Well, let's go, Lion Guard.

281
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.750
At least he's not mad at us
for almost losing that egg.

Why should he be?

you can't jump like a lion.

meet her there.

to boost the other,

show us the way to Udugu.

Whoo!

493
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.249
That was un-Bunga-lievable!

494
00:20:51.249 --> 00:20:52.289
I kinda wanna do it again.

495
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.170
Nice job, guys.

496
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.290
Simba's safe, and so are
the gazelles and ostriches.

497
00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.830
That's because
you did it your way.

498
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.499
Kion would be proud of you.

499
00:21:01.499 --> 00:21:03.329
And so am I.

500
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.290
So, everyone,
how was your journey?

501
00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.540
Did you find Udugu?

502
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:12.749
We found it.

503
00:21:12.749 --> 00:21:14.209
But it's not really
a place.

504
00:21:14.209 --> 00:21:17.249
It's about us working together
as brother and sister.

505
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:18.790
As a team.

506
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.290
How did things go
with the Guard?

507
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.290
Well, in a way,

508
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.329
the Guard helped me
find Udugu, too.

509
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:28.879
It's an important lesson.

510
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.250
It is,
especially for you two.

511
00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:38.209
And as Queen
of the Pride Lands

512
00:21:38.209 --> 00:21:40.209
and leader
of the Lion Guard,

513
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.880
someday you will be
responsible for all of this.

514
00:21:50.289 --> 00:21:52.499
So hold on to what
you learned today.

515
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.670
Then you'll always
have Udugu.
